* The different ways of inducing positive interdependence (roles, goals, rewards, as/symmetrical information, or other task structures, or something else, or nothing?)
* What type of task it is (McGraths circumplex)
* Any considerations about group composition (size, homo/heterogeneous traits, which traits, etc)

# Updated 10/13/19 (Will add on types of tasks later) 

## The following eight cooperative learning methods were discussed in Johnson and Johnson (2000). 
  
**1.Learning Together (LT) (Johnson & Johnson,1975/1999) 

**Description**: 
Their work about learning together was published on the book Learning Together and Alone. I was not able to access their book either online or through library. **There are more of conceptual understandings, thus no applications have been found**. 
However, Kagan mentioned the differences between his methods and Learning Together. The Johnsons postulate five conditions under which cooperative learning is productive: 
* 1. Clearly perceived Positive Interdependence 
* 2. Considerable promotive Face-to-Face interaction 
* 3. Clearly perceived Individual Accountability and personal responsibility to achieve the group's goals 
* 4. Frequent use of the relevant Interpersonal and Small-Group Skills 
* 5. Frequent and regular Group Processing of current functioning to improve the group's future effectiveness.

**2.	Teams-Games Tournaments (TGT) (DeVries & Edwards, 1974)  C** 

* Ways of Interdependece: **Threat. Reward**
* Type of tasks (McGraths circumplex): **Type 3 Intellective Tasks** (Problems have a clearly demonstratable right answer. )
* Group Composition: **4-5 each;  Hetero (stratified on verbal abililities)**; "maximal heterogeneity within each team (on such dimensions as student academic ability, sex, and race) and comparability across teams" 
* Screenshots and other info: N/A

**Description**：Three key components: *teams, games, and tournaments*
Description of the study:  The study was conducted for a six-week period and employed a simple, two-group comparison, contrasting TGT with a control treatment involving traditional instructional approaches (meaning lecturing style classrooms, but students were nominally assigned to five-member teams). Each treatment group comprised a separate language arts class, with both classes meeting during the same time period of the day. Students were assigned, on a stratified-random basis (stratifying on verbal ability), to either of the two treatment groups. Each treatment group met daily for a 50-minute period. Teacher effect was partially controlled by rotation of teachers across treatment groups every 5-7 days, resulting in equal exposure of both teachers to both treatment conditions.
The games are played in **weekly** tournaments in which each student competes with two other students of comparable ability representing other teams. At the end of each tournament session (typically lasting from 30 to 45 minutes) a "top scorer," "middle scorer," and "low scorer" is declared at each three-person game table. The individual student's game scores are converted to team scores and winning teams are declared. Classroom newsletters (distributed weekly) provide public feedback and reinforcement for both team and individual scores after each tournament.

**3.	Group Investigation (GI) (Sharan & Sharan,1976, 1992) D** 

* Ways of Interdependece: **Goal, Role** (step 2, recorder, coordinator, resource persons nd steering committee), Resource (Step 3: students go to different locations, library, musuem, inside school, etc), 
* Type of tasks (McGraths circumplex): **Type 1: Generating plans**
* Group Composition: **Based on interested topics, and teacher will limit the # of students in a group or further divide into two or more groups. No word on student charactersitics**. 
* Screenshots and other info:

**Description:** 
* Stage 1: Identify the topic to be investigated and organizing students into research groups (There are 5 steps in stage 1.)
namely the teacher helps students find research interests and form research groups. 
* Stage 2: Planning the investigation in groups 
* Stage 3: Carrying out an investigation

**4.	Academic Controversy (Johnson & Johnson, 1979),  D** 

The phrase was also used interchangeble with constructive controversy in Johnson and Johnson article. 
* Ways of Interdependece: **Identity** as they share the same ideas
* Type of tasks (McGraths circumplex): **Type 5 Cognitive Conflict tasks** (It's not Type 6 mixed-motive task because students do not have conflicting interests) and Type 4 Decision making tasks w/No Right answer. 
* Group Composition: It does not specify group size, but did mention **"small group". Heterogeniety**. The differences among students in terms of personality, sex, attitudes, background, social class, cognitive reasoning strategies, cognitive perspectives, information, and skills. 
* Screenshots and other info:

![Image of Constroversy](https://github.com/linyuunc/hello-world/blob/master/Picture1.png)
**Description:**
Controversy exists when one person's ideas, information, conclusions, theories, or opinions are incompatible with those of another person, and the two seek to reach an agreement. The author introduces the concept by talking about a scene in social science class when two students get into an argument about why citizens want to be representatives in Congress. The four steps are described below and graph is included for better understanding.

**5.	Jigsaw (Aronson, et al., 1978) D**
**Description**
The original jigsaw was published in his book The Jigsaw Classroom (not accessible), and below is the steps that listed on https://www.jigsaw.org/#steps

 * Ways of Interdependece: **Role (one leader), Resource ( asymmetry in original group, symmetry in new group), Goal**
* Type of tasks (McGraths circumplex): **Typically type 3 Intellective tasks**
* Group Composition: 5-6 students, The groups should be diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity, race, and ability.

**6.	Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD) (Slavin, 1978) C**
**Description:**
* Ways of Interdependece: **reward, goal**
* Type of tasks (McGraths circumplex): **Mostly type 3 Intellective tasks**
* Group Composition:  **4- to 5-member heterogeneous**, student scores are compared only with those of an ability-homogeneous reference group instead of the entire class
* Screenshots and other info:
![Image of STAD schedule](https://github.com/linyuunc/group-tasks/blob/master/Schedules%20for%20STAD.png)
![Image of STAD group scoring](https://github.com/linyuunc/group-tasks/blob/master/STAD%20group%20scording.png)

(STAD) uses the same 4- to 5-member heterogeneous teams used in TGT, but replaces the games and tournaments with simple, 15-minute quizzes, which students take after studying in their teams. The quiz scores are translated into team scores using a system called *achievement divisions*. The quiz scores of the highest six students in past performance are compared, and the top scorer in this group (the achievement division) earns eight points for his or her team, the second scorer earns six points, and so forth. Then the quiz scores of the next highest six students in past performance are compared, and so on. In this way, student scores are compared only with those of an ability-homogeneous reference group instead of the entire class.

## Other Collaborative Learning Environment (Updated 10.01.19) More details needed

* Knowledge Forum (Scardamalia & Bereiter, Chapter 20 IHLS) 
Tools: 
* Sensemaker of the WISE project ((Linn, Davis, & Bell, 2008; see Andriessen & Baker, Chapter 22, IHLS)
Make argumentation highly visible to encourage productive debate between competing scientiic ideas. 

* Learning by Design (Kolodner, 2006)
encourages learners to carefully check which “physical facts” other groups use when they design a balloon car, all made visibly different from others in the form of white-boarding. They design a car based on the given “evidence,” experimented and reported by other groups, to win the race.

* Hypothesis-Experiment Instruction 
This is simiar to "predict-observe-explain" method used to overcome scientific misconceptions. 

* The Knowledge Constructive Jigsaw  (lesson con- sists of a set of strategic procedures for discussion and a “problem,” an experiment whose answer is predicted and discussed by the students. An HEI unit consists of multiple such problems, carefully ordered to guide the devel- opment of scientiic concepts underlying the problem set. Each student in an HEI class is expected to integrate the results of the experiments in her/his own way to formulate a hypothesis. These differing hypotheses then are used to facilitate whole classroom discussion (Hatano & Inagaki, 1986).

## Below are from Chen et al’s website: Updated 10.13

**Role assignment**

* In Chen et al (2012)
 This is a strategy of structuring collaborative activities in group learning (Morris et al., 2010; Strijbos et al., 2004). According to Hare (1994), roles can be defined as stated or prescribed responsibilities or duties guiding individual behavior and regulating collaboration. Each designated role may assume a type of task completion function, such as *data collector, data analyzer, leader, or coordinator, generally assigned by the researcher or instructor*.

* In Dillenbourg and Hong (2008)
* Citation:https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00692019/document**
They encounter two types of roles in CSCL scripts, ‘induced’ roles and ‘natural’ roles. Induced roles are roles proposed by the script with a low or high degree of coercion. Natural roles refer to the exploitation of differences that exist between students before entering the script. Roles can be induced by restricting access to specific resources 1)documents 2)tools or by defining specific 3)responsibilities related to student authentication in the system.

Based on the second possible reason, more technology-based assistance may be needed to help teachers easily and efficiently build their scripts for task structure (e.g., Miller & Hadwin, 2015; Vogel et al., 2016; Weinberger, Stegmann, & Fischer, 2010) and to help bolster participants’ awareness of the cooperative process and products during their interaction with peers (e.g., Janssen, Erkens, Kirschner, & Kanselaar, 2010; Winne, Hadwin, & Gress, 2010).

Effects of Mobile-Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning
attention to how to provide sufficient logistics, such as the variability of learning scenarios, and software for enhancing teachers’ ability to arrange group learning scripts; how to monitor and encourage students’ interaction and proper workflow; and teachers’ professional development for their leadership roles for more pro- ductive outcomes in CSCL (Resta & Laferrière, 2007).

**1.	Noroozi, Biemans, Weinberger, Mulder, and Chizari (2013) found that collaboration scripts greatly fostered learners’ skills, group task performance, and social interactions.**

* Citation: https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0360131512002035?token=0E8186DC0C01759C09461D6EA809BEAC3886EF1C2582C5AF8BD426907BB23CA1EBFE3557C5234809E72EE8274B66C435

* Collaboration scripts provide detailed and explicit guidelines for small groups of learners to clarify what, when and by whom certain activities need to be executed (Weinberger, Stegmann, & Fischer, 2007). Scripts come in different forms (explicit or implicit; graphically embedded in a CSCL tool or included in a teacher’s oral presentation or hand-out materials) (Kollar, Fischer, & Hesse, 2006) and can sequence and specify both individual and collaborative learning activities to facilitate various learning processes and outcomes, including argumentative knowledge construction (seeWeinberger & Fischer, 2006). To prevent split attention of the learners, CSCL scripts have often been realized through prompts (Baker & Lund, 1997). 

Prompts can (as in this study)take the form of **sentence starters** (Nussbaum, Hartley, Sinatra, Reynolds, & Bendixen, 2004; McAllister et al., 2004; Ravenscroft, 2007)or **question stems** (Ge & Land, 2004) and provide learners with **guidelines, hints, and suggestions** that facilitate the enacting of scripts (Ge &Land, 2004; Noroozi, Weinberger et al., 2012; Weinberger, Ertl, Fischer, & Mandl, 2005).

**2.	Dillenbourg, 2002 mentioned that the following of CSCL scripts**
* Citation: https://telearn.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00190230/document

**The Grid Script** 
It uses Jigsaw as an example. The Design rational of the script is the complementary of knowledge. 

**The ArgueGraph Script**
It is based on a simple multiple-choice questionnaire produced by the teacher. It integrates face-to-face and online activities. 
"where a teacher designs a multiple choice question, with each student selecting an answer. The spread of answers is displayed for all to see and the teacher uses the range of answers to guide a classroom discussion" (From CHLS Chapter 25 Mobile Learning).

**The UniverSante Script**
It was used in medical education, more precisely in teaching community health. It integrates face-to-face and online activities. 

Other CSCL Scripts he introduced include: Need more details 
**The Magic Book** 
Used in primary schools following an expedition in Antartica 
**The Courseware Design Studio**
It supports project-based learning 
**Problem-based learning**
Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980 
**Reciprocal teaching** 
Palincsar and Brown (1984): one peer reads a text paragraph and the other questions him/her about his/her understanding, for the next paragraph the roles are shifted. 

**3.	In Dillenbourg and Hong (2008)**
* Citation: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00692019/document

Three more detailed examples of CSCL macro-scripts: 
* ArgueGraph: to trigger argumentation between peers 
(Levels of interactions are individual, class, group, class, and individual)
* ConceptGrid: (a sub-class of JIGSAW scripts). (Levels are Group, Individual, Group, Individual, Group, Class) 
* Wimsim: It addesses two pitfalls of enquiry-based learning (De Jong and Van Joolingen 1998): the lack of explicit negotiation of parameters (Phase 3) and the difficulty of interpreting the representations of results (Phase 6).

It examined the effects of using collaboration scripts as a group interaction–support- ing strategy and reported a small ES of 0.20 for domain-specific knowledge and a large positive ES of 0.95 for argumentation skill when compared with collaboration without scripts. 
It recognizes the internal scripts (Fischer et al., 2013), play, scene, scriptlet, and role;and covers three different factors as potentional moderators of the effectiveness of CSCL scripts, transactivity, script level, additional content-related support.

They proposed  a  multi-dimensional  approach  to  analyze  argumentative  knowledgeconstruction in CSCL from sampling and segmentation of the discourse corpora to the analysis of four pro-cess dimensions (participation, epistemic, argumentative, social mode)

**6. A Knowledge Communities aand Inquiry (KCI) Script by Slotta, Quintana, and Moher (2018) in IHLS**
Description: The first phase was conducted as a whole-class activity, with students familiarizing themselves with all four habitats to inform a community-wide knowledge base of the habitats, the species, and their interdependencies. The four ecosystems varied in terms of habitat conditions (how much pipe and brick, and what temperature) and also varied in terms of the population levels of different species (flora and fauna). Students were divided into four teams, with each taking stewardship of one wall (i.e., its habitat and denizen species), and tasked with understanding their habitat and species, then reasoning and problem-solving around any observed perturbations, making use of community-level knowledge, and sharing their own findings with the wider community. 

* Phase 1: Students walked into their classroom and discover the WallCology EP that was installed in their classrooms. The EP simulation ran continuously (i.e., all day) on the four monitors that were positioned on four different walls around the room, each displaying a distinct ecosystem. Students used the Common Knowledge tools to record observations, including details about the species’ behav- ior, physical traits, habitat preferences, and food preferences. 

* Phase 2: Students entered their classrooms and discovered that a major perturbation had taken place within their group’s ecosystem. This was immediately apparent in terms of drastic changes in populations of some of the species in the ecosystems.

* Phase 3: In the final phase, teams could make changes to their ecosystems by either introducing a new species, or increasing or decreasing a species that was already present. The goal was to improve the overall health of the ecosystem, either by trying to return the ecosystem to its original state or by creating a more diverse ecosystem (i.e., with a robust combination of predators, herbivores, and resource

**Types of cooperative learning**
* Formal Cooperative 
* Informal Cooperative Learning Groups (turn and talk)
* Cooperative Base Groups(Long-term groups (lasting for at least one semester or year) with stable membership whose primary responsibility is to give each member the support, encouragement, and assistance he or she needs to progress academically and develop cognitively and socially in healthy ways.  )

**Things to consider when doing cooprative learning assignments** 
* Size (smallest group 2 to largest group 6. Small groups requrire few social skills and work quickly. Large group deal better with complex ideas)
* Formation (Heterogeneous or homogeneous; self-selection or random assignment)
* Duration 

**Assigning roles in groups**
A few ways: 
Facilitator, Recorder,Presenter,Materials Manager, Time Keeper, Checker
Reader, Recorder, Encourager of Participation and Checker for Understanding. (Johnson & Johnson)

**A few other activities**
* **Stump Your Partner**

Students take a minute to create a challenging question based on the lecture content up to that point.
Students pose the question to the person sitting next to them.
To take this activity a step further, ask students to write down their questions and hand them in. These questions can be used to create tests or exams. They can also be reviewed to gauge student understanding.


* **Think-Pair-Share/Write-Pair-Share**
The instructor poses a question that demands analysis, evaluation, or synthesis.
Students take a few minutes to think through an appropriate response.
Students turn to a partner (or small groups) and share their responses. Take this a step further by asking students to find someone who arrived at an answer different from their own and convince their partner to change their mind.
Student responses are shared within larger teams or with the entire class during a follow-up discussion.


* **Catch-Up**
Stop at a transition point in your lecture.
Have students turn to a partner or work in small groups to compare notes and ask clarifying questions.
After a few minutes, open the floor to a few questions.


* **Fishbowl Debate**
Ask students to sit in groups of three.
Assign roles. For example, the person on left takes one position on a topic for debate, the person on right takes the opposite position, and the person in the middle takes notes and decides which side is the most convincing and provides an argument for his or her choice.
Debrief by calling on a few groups to summarize their discussions.


* **Case Study**
Create four to five case studies of similar difficulty.
Have students work in groups of four or five to work through and analyze their case study.
Provide 10-15 minutes (or adequate time) to work through the cases.
Walk around and address any questions.
Call on groups randomly and ask that students share their analysis. Continue until each case study has been addressed.


* **Team-Based Learning**
Start a course unit by giving students some tasks to complete, such as reading or lab assignments. Consider assigning these to be completed before class.
Check students' comprehension of the material with a quick multiple-choice quiz. Have students submit their answers.
Assign students to groups and have them review their answers with group members to reach consensus. Have each group submit one answered quiz.
Record both the individual student assessment scores and the final group assessment score (both of which are used toward each student's course grade).
Deliver a lecture that specially targets any misconceptions or gaps in knowledge the assessments reveal.
Give groups a challenging assignment, such as solving a problem or applying a theory to a real-world situation.

* **Group Problem-Solving** 
There are many instructional strategies that involve students working together to solve a problem, including inquiry-based learning, authentic learning, and discovery learning. While they each have their own unique characteristics, they fundamentally involve:
Presenting students with a problem.
Providing some structure or guidance toward solving the problem. Note however, that they are all student-centered activities in which the instructor may have a very minimal role.
Reaching a final outcome or solution.
