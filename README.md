# group-tasks
This includes a list of group tasks that are used in cooperative learning, peer tutoring and computer-supported collaborative learning

**Basic Elements of Cooprative teams (Johnson. R. T& Johnson.D.W)**

* Positive Interdependece
* Individual Accountability
* Face-to-Face Promotive Interaction??
* Interpersonal And Small Group Skills
* Group Processing

**Types of cooperative learning**
Formal Cooperative 
Informal Cooperative Learning Groups (turn and talk)
Cooperative Base Groups(Long-term groups (lasting for at least one semester or year) with stable membership whose primary responsibility is to give each member the support, encouragement, and assistance he or she needs to progress academically and develop cognitively and socially in healthy ways.  )

## Things to consider when doing cooprative learning assignments
* Size (smallest group 2 to largest group 6. Small groups requrire few social skills and work quickly. Large group deal better with complex ideas)
* Formation (Heterogeneous or homogeneous; self-selection or random assignment)
* Duration 

**Assigning roles in groups**
A few ways: 
Facilitator, Recorder,Presenter,Materials Manager, Time Keeper, Checker
Reader, Recorder, Encourager of Participation and Checker for Understanding. (Johnson & Johnson)

**Jig-Saw Procedure** (Johnson and Johnson)

Task:  Think of a reading assignment you will give in the near future.  Divide the assignment in three parts.  Plan how you will use the jig-saw procedure.  Script out exactly what you will say to your class in using each part of the jig-saw procedure.

Procedure:  One way to structure positive interdependence among group members is to use the jigsaw method of creating resource interdependence.  The steps for structuring a "jigsaw" lesson are:  

1.  Cooperative Groups:  Distribute a set of materials to each group.  The set needs to be divisible into the number of members of the group (2, 3, or 4 parts).  Give each member one part of the set of materials.

2.  Preparation Pairs:  Assign students the cooperative task of meeting with someone else in the class who is a member of another learning group and who has the same section of the material and complete two tasks:  

a.  Learning and becoming an expert on their material.

b.  Planning how to teach the material to the other members of their groups. 

3.  Practice Pairs:  Assign students the cooperative task of meeting with someone else in the class who is a member of another learning group and who has learned the same material and share ideas as to how the material may best be taught.  These "practice pairs" review what each plans to teach their group and how.  The best ideas of both are incorporated into each's presentation. 

4.  Cooperative Groups:  Assign students the cooperative tasks of:  

a.  Teaching their area of expertise to the other group members.  

b.  Learning the material being taught by the other members.  

5.  Evaluation:  Assess students' degree of mastery of all the material.  Reward the groups whose members all reach the preset criterion of excellence.  

**A few other activities**
*Stump Your Partner

Students take a minute to create a challenging question based on the lecture content up to that point.
Students pose the question to the person sitting next to them.
To take this activity a step further, ask students to write down their questions and hand them in. These questions can be used to create tests or exams. They can also be reviewed to gauge student understanding.


*Think-Pair-Share/Write-Pair-Share
The instructor poses a question that demands analysis, evaluation, or synthesis.
Students take a few minutes to think through an appropriate response.
Students turn to a partner (or small groups) and share their responses. Take this a step further by asking students to find someone who arrived at an answer different from their own and convince their partner to change their mind.
Student responses are shared within larger teams or with the entire class during a follow-up discussion.


*Catch-Up
Stop at a transition point in your lecture.
Have students turn to a partner or work in small groups to compare notes and ask clarifying questions.
After a few minutes, open the floor to a few questions.


*Fishbowl Debate
Ask students to sit in groups of three.
Assign roles. For example, the person on left takes one position on a topic for debate, the person on right takes the opposite position, and the person in the middle takes notes and decides which side is the most convincing and provides an argument for his or her choice.
Debrief by calling on a few groups to summarize their discussions.


*Case Study
Create four to five case studies of similar difficulty.
Have students work in groups of four or five to work through and analyze their case study.
Provide 10-15 minutes (or adequate time) to work through the cases.
Walk around and address any questions.
Call on groups randomly and ask that students share their analysis. Continue until each case study has been addressed.


*Team-Based Learning
Start a course unit by giving students some tasks to complete, such as reading or lab assignments. Consider assigning these to be completed before class.
Check students' comprehension of the material with a quick multiple-choice quiz. Have students submit their answers.
Assign students to groups and have them review their answers with group members to reach consensus. Have each group submit one answered quiz.
Record both the individual student assessment scores and the final group assessment score (both of which are used toward each student's course grade).
Deliver a lecture that specially targets any misconceptions or gaps in knowledge the assessments reveal.
Give groups a challenging assignment, such as solving a problem or applying a theory to a real-world situation.

*Group Problem-Solving
There are many instructional strategies that involve students working together to solve a problem, including inquiry-based learning, authentic learning, and discovery learning. While they each have their own unique characteristics, they fundamentally involve:
Presenting students with a problem.
Providing some structure or guidance toward solving the problem. Note however, that they are all student-centered activities in which the instructor may have a very minimal role.
Reaching a final outcome or solution.
